Project to generate in the most standard way a scientific paper by guiding the user by questions to fullfill. 

Use
---

(IN DEVELOPMENT, many options still not available, including the automatic .tex creation)
Just answer the questions and choose your journal format (currently just "draft paper"). The program will create a .tex file with the choosen format. The output text are just the answers in the right position on the paper.

The purpose of SPG is to help you to have a 3/4 already paper in a simple way. The 1/4 of the paper is up to you (connect in a human way the text, put figure, and check any detail).

Any suggest and improve is accepted.
