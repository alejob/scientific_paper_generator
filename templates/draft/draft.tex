A nice introduction.

\section{Some section}
\label{sc:asd}

Figures at the end of the draft.

Equations:
\begin{equation}
  \langle E_j(t) \rangle = \frac{\sum_{\alpha} \int dx f_{\alpha}
  E_j}{\sum_{\alpha} \int dx f_{\alpha}} \,. \label{average}
\end{equation}
%

Two-coloumn equations:
\begin{widetext}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{promt}
    \langle E_j(t) \rangle = \sum_{\alpha} \left[ \langle
      E_j(t)\rangle_{\alpha} + \sum_\ell \langle \Delta h_\ell(0)
      E_j(t)\rangle_\alpha^{(\ell)} - \langle E_j(t) \rangle_{\alpha}
      \sum_{\beta,\ell} \langle \Delta h_\ell(0) \rangle_\beta^{(\ell)} \right]\,.
  \end{equation}
\end{widetext}
%

Aligned equations
\begin{eqnarray}
  \langle A(t) \rangle_{\alpha} &=& \frac{\int dx F_{\alpha}
  A}{\sum_{\beta} \int dx F_{\beta}} \,,
  \\
  \langle A(t) \rangle_\alpha^{(\ell)} &=& \frac{\int dx
  (\partial F_\alpha/\partial H_\ell) A}{\sum_{\beta} \int dx F_{\beta}} \,.
  \label{ave_Fal}
\end{eqnarray}
